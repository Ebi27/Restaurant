# Responsive restaurant Website
# Final project from the SheCodes Responsive Web class. 
####### Overview #######
I started by creating the structure of the page using HTML. This began with the design of the header, which appears on every page of the Portfolio.
Then there was the footer, which listed additional contact options such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. 
This was also added on every page. I added contents for each page which was partly laid out using Flexbox and to for responsiveness by using properties such as 
justify contents, aligning contents, creating columns and rows. I went ahead and styled it with CSS while also creating the responsive features. 

The only issue right now is the footer area on mobile. It's not centered and i have tried using flexbox and css to center but changes are not being applied.
